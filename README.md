Abstract

Purpose: Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Subtyping the disease and identifying the genomic features driving these disease subtypes are the key for precision oncology for breast cancer. This study focuses on developing computational approaches for breast cancer subtyping. 

Methods: We proposed to use Bayesian tensor factorization (BTF) to integrate multiomics data of breast cancer, which include expression profiles of RNA-sequencing, copy number alteration and DNA methylation measured on 771 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a consensus clustering approach to identify breast cancer subtypes using the factorized latent features. Subtype-specific survival patterns of the breast cancer patients were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimators. The proposed approach was compared with other state-of-the-art approaches for cancer subtyping. 

Results: The BTF-subtyping analysis identified 17 optimized latent components, which were used to reveal six major breast cancer subtypes. Out of all the different approaches, only the KM analysis of the cancer subtypes resulted by our approach showed distinct survival patterns (p < 0.05) among all the approaches. Statistical testing analysis also showed that the identified clusters have statistically significant distributions. 

Conclusion: Our preliminary data showed that the proposed approach is a promising strategy to efficiently use publicly available multiomics data to identify breast and other cancer subtypes. Since BTF is relatively time-consuming, future work is to implement efficient BTF related algorithms to speed up the factorization for integration of larger multiomics data sets.
